1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React is a library used to make your UI code more organized ,DRY, and overall simplier. An example being the use of diffrent components. Rather than digging through nesting upon nesting it's easier to find your code in a seperate file. JSX also makes it easier to understand/read when working with the code since it's so similar to HTML. Apparently it's also super easy to test.

1. Describe component state.

Component state sets an intial value then allows the ability to change, hold, and rerender the component.

1. Describe props.

A reservation for data. It's a promise that they will come later to allow the data to be passed in elsewhere.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

An action that affects something outside the scope of the function. You sync it by calling it in the component.
